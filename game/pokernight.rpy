bh "Ahhhh~ That was delicious."

twins "Mmm-hmm~"

mc "Yeah, I’m stuffed!"

gh "I’m happy you all liked it. I’ve had that recipe for over 20 years now."

fo "Well now that the table’s cleared…"

ba "We can finally play some Midnight Poker."

bh "That is, if you still want to. If you want to call it a night I can give you a ride home."

mc "Nah, I’m good to play."

bh "Alright then. This’ll be fun, I know it!"

##Midnight Poker

##Cut to the Poker Table Scene from the player’s POV. Looking at Boris, Grigory and the Twins

gh "Alright, before we begin, I’ll recite the rules to make sure we’re all on the same page."

gh "The game we’re playing is Texas Hold ‘Em."

gh "Once the lights are out, the game begins. Each of us will have a small like to help us see the cards."

gh "If anyone’s caught cheating, they lose the game."

bh "Oh! And instead of poker chips, we play for chips!"

"Boris pulls out a bag of chips and pours them into a bowl on the table."

gh "Heheh, yes. And the winner is determined by who wins all the chips."
"The chips are divided evenly among all of you."

gh "And with that, let the game begin!"

##The lights turn off and everyone’s eye lights start glowing.

gh "I’ll deal the first hand."

"The first hand is dealt to everyone."

##Your cards appear at the bottom of the screen. First round is 5 of Clubs, and King of Hearts

##The Twins go first.

ba "Hmm… I’ll call."

fo "Check."

bh "I also call!"

##Game mechanics need to be worked on.

##Convos that occur during the game

##The Ant colony

bh "So, Bahd, Forzaw, do you do as much traveling when you’re at the university?"

ba "Not as much as we’d like."

fo "Though when we do, we’re often asked to make an expedition to do research on a certain insect species."

ba "A few years ago, we got to travel to the Amazon to study a newly discovered species of ants."

mc "What’s so special about these ants?"

fo "Well, these weren’t just any ordinary ant colony. These ants were showing signs of a higher level of intelligence never seen before in insects."

bh "How so?"

fo "Well for one thing, their ant hill looked more like a fortress than a traditional ant hill. It had moats, as well as canopies made of leaves and sticks. The ants had also somehow managed to manipulate bigger insects like dragonflies and stag beetles into doing manual labor for them."

ba "They also apparently have no queen. One of our colleagues reported that they witnessed what seemed like an ‘uprising’. They rejected the Queen’s control over the colony and instead based their major decisions on some sort of group communication."

mc "That sounds really strange."

fo "The last time we saw them, they were using the dragonflies to create some sort of flying platform. What they were planning to do with it, we have no idea."

ba "We plan on going back to study them further once we return to the university."

##Boris gets banned from Vegas and The Siren Singer

bh "You know, when I first moved to America, I took a trip to Las Vegas for the summer. It was a lot of fun and the food was wonderful. But sadly, I've been banned from all casinos."

ba "What were you banned for?"

bh "For 'tampering' with the slots and eating all their poker chips."

fo "Why would you eat the poker chips?"

bh "I thought they were snacks! They looked colorful and tasty! And everyone was gathered around what I assumed was a buffet table."

gh "Good thing I picked up potato chips instead."

mc "Wait, didn't you have to go to the hospital after eating plastic?"

bh "No. I had a stomach ache for a while but I was fine afterward. I once went to a doctor after I accidentally ate a cereal box toy and it was half digested when I arrived. She said I had the strongest stomach acids of any human being she’d ever seen."

fo "Cool."
ba "Wicked."

bh "I also have hollow bones and can squeeze myself under doors with enough effort."

twins "So can we!"

"Is this normal in the family? You think to yourself."

gh "Hmm... You know what Boris, you're starting to remind me a lot of your great grandmother from your mother's side, Penelope."

bh "Penelope?... My mother never spoke of her."


gh "She lived in Poland and was rather reclusive. Your mother and I went to visit her a year before you were born. She was also a Siren."

##mc and Boris
"A Siren!?"

gh "Yes. She was a very successful singer back then. We went to see her oon one of her last shows before retirement."

gh "It seems you've inherited a few things from her."

bh "Well, that would explain why I always feel the urge to sing when I visit the beach."

gh "I still have some of her records if any of you want to give them a listen. Her singing was captivating."


## Grig the Gambler

gh "There was a period in my life where I was a bit of a gambler."

gh "I once went on vacation to England where I was on a winning streak. I was at a pub and after winning 4 tournaments in a row I was feeling cocky. So I challenged a group of these steely eyed, gruff looking sailors to a card game."

bh "What happened next?"

gh "They looked at me dead in the eyes and told me there's one game and one game only they play. That being 'Go Fish'. I ended up losing in that game and my winning streak ended there."

bh "Do you still gamble?"

gh "Oh no. I had to quit my bad habits when the twins were born."

twins "We're a lifetime investment."

gh "And worth every penny."
